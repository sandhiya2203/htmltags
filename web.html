         <p>Social media is a tool that has become immensely popular among all generations due to its user-friendly interface.</p>
            <pre>
                If in this world there weren't any social media,
                 We would enjoy gaining knowledge from books and encyclopedia. 
                 The world would stop sharing their personal information,
                 The teenagers would study with full concentration.
                 The parents should spend time with children instead of scrolling their Facebook wall,
                 In the cells there would be nothing instead of an option for call. 
                Nowadays people considered social media above all,
                It will soon reduce because one day everything has a fall. 
                I can't live without it even one day I can't resist, 
                 I am so addicted that I am unable to obey what my mother insist
                A world without social media is a forest without trees, 
                Don't be addicted to it please please please!
